#### What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
I think that this course has helped me to become more well rounded in my understanding of technology as a field. This course has helped me to understand cloud development and its applications. 
#### Describe your strengths as a software developer.
My main strength as a software developer is attention to detail. I think it is important to ensure that all requirements of a program are met, and this requires paying attention to what the end user will want and need. 
#### Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
In a new job, I think I would be prepared to handle front and backend development. There would definitely be a learning curve as there would in any job, but I think this course and the previous course has prepared me for that. 
#### How would you handle scale and error handling?
Scale and error handling are things that need to be kept in mind throughout the project. Cloud development allows for a lot of flexibility when it comes to scale, as you can scale up or down without being concerned for physical space. Error handling should be incorporated all throughout the development process and should be integral to the program.
#### How would you predict the cost?
Cost can be predicted based on the estimated size and data/space usage of the project, along with the tools used during development. You can also estimate the amount of requests you think your program will need to make and cost-out based on that. 
#### What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
This depends on the tasks required, but generally contianers are more cost predictable. Containers require fewer resources and are easier to predict costs. 
#### Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
When working with cloud development, one of the big pros is that expansion is something that is very possible. Cloud development offers alot of flexibility when it comes to expanding and scaling up. Cons would be that it can be a bit more difficult if the current architecture is outdated. If you are working with old legacy code, it can take a considerable amount of  money and resources to bring it up to date before expanding.
#### What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
Elasticity and pay-for-service are major pros when it comes to planned future growth. You can develop for the requirements you have now with the resources you have currently and upgrade down the road as you are able to.
